# Moment Pattern Java Project

This is a simple Java project that demonstrates the Moment pattern.

Overview

The Moment pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later. This is useful in situations where you need to preserve the state of an object for later use, or where you need to undo changes made to an object.

This project provides a simple example of how the Moment pattern can be implemented in Java. It includes a Moment class that represents a snapshot of an object's state, and a Originator class that creates and restores Moment objects. The project also includes a Client class that demonstrates how to use the Moment and Originator classes to capture and restore the state of an object.

Building and Running the Project
