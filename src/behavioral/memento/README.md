# Moment Pattern Java Project

Overview

The Moment pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later. This is useful in situations where you need to preserve the state of an object for later use, or where you need to undo changes made to an object.
