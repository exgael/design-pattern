# Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a new operation on a set of objects without changing the classes of the objects themselves. The pattern separates the algorithm from the object structure, promoting flexibility, extensibility, and cleaner separation of concerns in your application.

## Key Concepts

1. **Element**: An interface or abstract class that defines the method for accepting a visitor. The objects in the structure implement this interface to allow visitors to perform operations on them.
2. **Concrete Element**: A class that implements the Element interface or inherits from the abstract Element class. It contains the actual implementation of the accept method, which delegates the operation to the visitor.
3. **Visitor**: An interface or abstract class that defines the methods for performing operations on the concrete elements. Each method corresponds to a specific type of concrete element and is responsible for executing the operation on that element.
4. **Concrete Visitor**: A class that implements the Visitor interface or inherits from the abstract Visitor class. It contains the actual implementation of the operations for each type of concrete element in the object structure.
5. **Object Structure**: A collection of objects or data structures that represent the elements to be visited. It usually provides a way to iterate through or traverse the elements and apply the visitor's operations.

## Advantages

1. Separation of concerns: The Visitor Pattern separates the algorithms from the object structure, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
2. Extensibility: The pattern allows you to easily define new operations on the object structure without modifying the existing classes, making it more flexible and extensible.
3. Single Responsibility Principle: Each visitor class is responsible for a single operation, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Usage

Use the Visitor Pattern when:
- You have a complex object structure and you need to perform unrelated operations on it without changing the classes of the objects.
- You want to separate the algorithms from the object structure to make it more flexible and maintainable.
- You want to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by having each visitor class responsible for a single operation.

## Example

An example of the Visitor Pattern is a document processing system, where a document is composed of various elements such as paragraphs, images, and tables. The Visitor Pattern can be used to implement operations like rendering, exporting, or validating the document without modifying the element classes themselves. Each visitor class encapsulates a specific operation, making it easy to extend or modify the system without changing the underlying object structure.
